Design of OpenMP-based Parallel [Leiden algorithm] for [community detection].

Community detection involves identifying subsets of vertices that display higher connectivity within themselves than with the rest of the network. The widely used Louvain method, a heuristic-based approach for community detection, employs a two-phase process consisting of a local-moving phase and an aggregation phase. This iterative optimization targets the modularity metric, a measure of community quality. Despite its popularity, the Louvain method has been observed to generate internally-disconnected and poorly connected communities. In response to these limitations, Traag et al. propose the Leiden algorithm, which introduces a refinement phase between the local-moving and aggregation phases. This refinement phase allows vertices to explore and potentially form sub-communities within the identified communities from the local-moving phase, enabling the Leiden algorithm to identify well-connected communities.

Nevertheless, the original Leiden algorithm encounters computational bottlenecks when applied to massive graphs, primarily due to its inherently sequential nature, akin to the Louvain method. In scenarios where scalability is crucial, the development of an optimized parallel Leiden algorithm becomes essential, especially in the multicore/shared memory setting, given its energy efficiency and the prevalence of hardware with large memory sizes. Despite existing studies proposing various parallelization techniques for the Leiden algorithm, they do not address optimization for the aggregation phase, which emerges as a bottleneck after optimizing the local-moving phase. Additionally, several optimization techniques applicable to the Louvain method are also relevant to the Leiden algorithm. To tackle these challenges, we present **GVE-Leiden**, an optimized *parallel implementation of the Leiden algorithm* designed for shared memory multicores.

Below we plot the time taken by the [original Leiden], [igraph] Leiden, [NetworKit] Leiden, [cuGraph] Leiden, and GVE-Leiden on 13 different graphs. GVE-Leiden surpasses the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, NetworKit Leiden, and cuGraph Leiden by `436√ó`, `104√ó`, `8.2√ó`, and `3.0√ó` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `403M` edges/s on a `3.8ùêµ` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of GVE-Leiden wrt original Leiden, igraph Leiden, NetworKit Leiden, and cuGraph Leiden.

Next, we plot the modularity of communities identified by original Leiden, igraph Leiden, NetworKit Leiden, cuGraph Leiden, and GVE-Leiden. GVE-Leiden on average obtains `0.3%` lower modularity than original Leiden and igraph Leiden, `25%` higher modularity than NetworKit Leiden (especially on road networks and protein k-mer graphs), and 3.5% higher modularity that cuGraph Leiden (primarily due to cuGraph Leiden‚Äôs inability to run on well-clusterable graphs).

Then, we plot the fraction of disconnected communities obtained with each implementation. Here, the absence of bars signifies no disconnected communities. On average, communities identified by NetworKit Leiden and cuGraph Leiden have fractions of disconnected communities as follows: `1.5√ó10^‚àí2` and `6.6√ó10^‚àí5` respectively. None of the communities identified by the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and GVE-Leiden are internally-disconnected. As the Leiden algorithm guarantees the absence of disconnected communities, those observed with NetworKit Leiden and cuGraph Leiden are likely due to implementation issues.
